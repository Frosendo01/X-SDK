## Migration from C# SDK

This X++ SDK is a complete refactor of the original C# Model Context Protocol SDK, adapted for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply Chain Management:

### Key Differences from C# Version
- **Platform**: X++ instead of C#
- **Dependencies**: D365 platform instead of .NET Core/Standard
- **Project Structure**: Visual Studio with .rnrproj instead of modern .NET SDK
- **Async Patterns**: Synchronous calls instead of async/await
- **Generics**: Container types instead of generic collections
- **LINQ**: X++ loops instead of LINQ queries

### Maintained Functionality
- Complete MCP protocol implementation
- JSON-RPC communication
- HTTP client with authentication
- Error handling and logging
- Tool discovery and invocation
- Extensible architecture
